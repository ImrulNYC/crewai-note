- Applications of AI agents
- Importance of AI agents in modern systems

## Notes
- An **AI agent** is an *autonomous system* that perceives its environment using **sensors**, reasons about the perceptions, and takes actions through **actuators** to accomplish specific goals.  
- They operate in a *continuous cycle* that includes **observation**, **decision-making**, and **action**.  
- AI agents have the capability to **adapt over time** based on feedback received from their environment (Russell & Norvig, 2021).  

- There are various **types of AI agents**:
  - **Simple reflex agents**: Respond to immediate stimuli from the environment.  
  - **Goal-based agents**: Plan actions based on desired outcomes.  
  - **Utility-based agents**: Optimize actions for the highest utility from given choices (Poole, Mackworth, & Goebel, 1998).  

- **Learning agents** take the concept further by enhancing their performance using data derived from *previous experiences*. They often utilize techniques from **machine learning** (Goodfellow et al., 2016).  

- AI agents are *widely utilized* in applications such as:
  - **Virtual assistants** (e.g., Siri, Google Assistant)
  - **Recommendation systems** (e.g., Netflix, Amazon)
  - **Smart home devices** (e.g., smart thermostats, home security systems)
  - **Autonomous vehicles** (e.g., self-driving cars)  
  - They are a *core part* of modern AI systems (Siciliano et al., 2016).

## Summary
AI agents are autonomous systems that interact with their environment to achieve specific goals, learning and adapting over time. They come in various types such as reflex, goal-based, and utility-based agents, with applications across several domains, make them critical in modern artificial intelligence.
