# AI Agents

## Definition
- An AI agent is an autonomous system that:
  - Perceives its environment through sensors or data inputs
  - Reasons about what it perceives
  - Takes actions through actuators to achieve specific goals

## Operating Cycle
- AI agents operate in a continuous cycle:
  - Observation
  - Decision-making
  - Action
- They adapt over time based on:
  - Feedback from the environment
  - Enhancement of effectiveness in achieving goals

## Types of AI Agents
- AI agents are categorized based on decision-making capabilities:
  
  ### Reflex Agents
  - Simplest forms of agents
  - Respond to immediate stimuli
  - Lack internal memory of prior states
  - Corrected understanding:
    - May not incorporate complex condition-action rules, relying strictly on predefined conditions
  
  ### Goal-based Agents
  - Plan actions based on specific desired outcomes
  - Assess potential courses of action to achieve set goals

  ### Utility-based Agents
  - Evaluate actions based on expected utility or value
  - Aim to maximize overall satisfaction or benefit
  - Corrected understanding:
    - Consider risk and uncertainty, making them more sophisticated than basic goal-oriented agents

  ### Learning Agents
  - Continuously improve performance over time
  - Use data from previous experiences
  - Adapt strategies in dynamic environments

## Applications of AI Agents
- Integral to modern technology:
  - Virtual assistants
  - Recommendation systems
  - Smart home devices
  - Autonomous vehicles
- Corrected understanding:
  - Also used in complex scenarios such as:
    - Dynamic scheduling
    - Optimization problems
    - Advanced robotics

## Contributions to AI Systems
- AI agents significantly contribute to:
  - Advancement of artificial intelligence systems
  - Functionality and efficiency across diverse fields
