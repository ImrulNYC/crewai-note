# AI Agent Flashcards

- **Q: What is an AI agent?**  
  **A:** An AI agent is an autonomous system that perceives its environment, reasons about the information, and takes actions to achieve specific goals.

- **Q: How do AI agents operate?**  
  **A:** They operate in a continuous cycle of observation, decision-making, and action, adapting based on feedback from their environment.

- **Q: What are the types of AI agents?**  
  **A:** AI agents can be categorized into reflex agents, model-based reflex agents, goal-based agents, utility-based agents, learning agents, and hierarchical agents.

- **Q: What are reflex agents?**  
  **A:** Reflex agents respond to immediate stimuli without internal memory of past states. Model-based reflex agents maintain an internal representation of the environment for better flexibility.

- **Q: What are goal-based agents?**  
  **A:** Goal-based agents plan their actions to achieve specific desired outcomes, evaluating potential courses of action to meet set goals.

- **Q: What do utility-based agents evaluate?**  
  **A:** Utility-based agents evaluate actions based on their expected utility or value, aiming to maximize overall satisfaction or benefit.

- **Q: What are learning agents?**  
  **A:** Learning agents improve their performance over time by adapting strategies through data from previous experiences in dynamic environments.

- **Q: What are hierarchical agents?**  
  **A:** Hierarchical agents organize tasks into sub-agents, allowing complex tasks to be broken down into manageable parts.

- **Q: In which applications are AI agents widely used?**  
  **A:** AI agents are used in virtual assistants, recommendation systems, smart home devices, autonomous vehicles, and multi-agent systems for complex task coordination.

- **Q: How do AI agents function in competitive environments?**  
  **A:** AI agents can interact within competitive environments, such as games, to achieve objectives amid the presence of other agents.

- **Q: What is the significance of AI agents in technology?**  
  **A:** AI agents provide functionality and efficiency across various fields, contributing significantly to advancements in artificial intelligence systems.
